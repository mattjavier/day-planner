# Day Planner 

A daily planner that uses Moment.js to display the current day and hour of viewing the application. Some features include:

* Current day displayed at the top of schedule.

* Time blocks of standard business hours color coded to indicate the time of day upon viewing. Gray for past hours, red for the current hour, and green for hours yet to come.

* A text box where text can be inputed for events within a time block.

* A save button that saves events in local storage so the planner can retain these events upon refreshing the page.
